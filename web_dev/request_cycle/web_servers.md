The philossiphy to linux is that it is open source for users who know what they want to do to be able to do so. it gives you the flexiblity to do what you want when you want. In expaninding research for this question I found a great statement. Linux has philosophy is "treat all users with respect"
In other words it is simple enough and complex enough to have people using at all levels. and yet doesn't hold your hand when using.

a Virtual private server is a virtual computer that is self existing in its own space. This can be started up and shut down and modified in any facet. A VPS has advantages due to the fact that its less expensive then a full dedicated hosting plan that uses a physical server. It gives you a lot more control over the virtual server . Its more stable and reliable.

the reason you do not want to run programs as the root user on a Linux system si due to the fact that that is a big security risk. if someone hacked into the server, they would have complete control of the whole system down to the root directories.
