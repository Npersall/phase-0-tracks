          <p>If you would like for information on dogs check out this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">general info website</a>. Dogs have a beautiful relationship with humans, unfortunately humans don't return the love. Each year, thousands of dogs are put down because there is no home for them to go. At the same time, breeders keep breeding dogs for profit legally and illegally, leaving many with out a home. <em>Should you want to learn more about adoption and what you can do, check out <a href="https://carepets.org/">Care: Companion Animal Rescue Effort.</a> </em></p>
